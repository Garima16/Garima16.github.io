title : Recurrent Neural Networks Design Patterns
---
Recurrent Neural Networks or RNN have following 3 design patterns:

1. RNNs that produce an output at each time step and have recurrent connections between hidden units

2. RNNs that produce an output at each time step and have recurrent connections only from output at one time step
to hidden units at next time step.

3. RNNs with recurrent connections between hidden units, that read an entire sequence and then produce single output.
